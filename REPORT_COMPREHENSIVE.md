## 1. Introduction

The process of completing a thesis or dissertation represents one of the most challenging academic endeavors students face. The complexity of managing literature reviews, research methodologies, data collection, analysis, and writing over extended periods often overwhelms students, leading to procrastination, poor time management, and academic stress. Traditional project management tools, while helpful for general tasks, lack the specialized features needed for academic research workflows.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), present new opportunities to address these challenges. AI systems can assist with various aspects of academic work, from brainstorming research topics to generating structured timelines and providing specialized research tools. However, the integration of AI into academic workflows raises important questions about academic integrity, appropriate usage, and the balance between assistance and independent work.

This paper describes the development of a comprehensive AI-powered thesis management system designed to address these challenges while maintaining academic integrity. Our system, called "Thesis Helper," provides students with intelligent planning assistance, automated task generation, specialized academic tools, and integrated project management capabilities. The platform supports both local AI models (for privacy) and cloud-based services (for performance), allowing users to choose their preferred approach based on their needs and institutional policies.

The primary research questions addressed in this work include: (1) How can AI be effectively integrated into academic project management workflows? (2) What specialized tools are most beneficial for students working on thesis projects? (3) How can we ensure ethical AI usage while providing meaningful assistance? Our implementation demonstrates practical solutions to these questions through a full-stack web application that has been iteratively developed and tested.

## 2. Materials & Methods

### 2.1 System Architecture

The Thesis Helper system follows a modern web application architecture with clear separation between frontend, backend, and external service integrations. The frontend is built using Next.js 14 with React 18 and TypeScript, providing a responsive and type-safe user interface. Styling is implemented using Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistent design patterns.

The backend utilizes FastAPI (Python) with SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations and Pydantic for data validation. The system employs SQLite for development and can be easily configured for PostgreSQL in production environments. Asynchronous programming patterns are used throughout to handle concurrent AI model interactions and external API calls efficiently.

### 2.2 AI Integration Framework

Two primary AI providers are integrated to offer flexibility in deployment scenarios:

**Local AI (Ollama):** For privacy-conscious users and institutions, we integrated Ollama to run Llama models locally. This approach ensures that sensitive academic content never leaves the user's environment while providing full AI capabilities.

**Cloud AI (Google Gemini):** For users requiring maximum performance, Google Gemini API integration provides access to state-of-the-art language models with faster response times and potentially higher quality outputs.

The AI service layer abstracts these providers behind a common interface, allowing seamless switching between local and cloud-based models based on user preferences or institutional requirements.

### 2.3 Core Features Implementation

**Brainstorming Module:** Interactive chat interface for thesis topic development, utilizing conversation history to suggest topic finalization when sufficient context is gathered.

**Timeline Generation:** AI-powered analysis of user requirements (thesis field, deadline, available hours, work patterns) to generate detailed project timelines with granular task breakdown and realistic time estimates.

**Task Management:** Integration with Notion API for professional project management, including automated workspace creation, task synchronization, and progress tracking.

**Academic Tools Suite:** Implementation of 18 specialized tools including grammar checking, web search and fact-checking, Wikipedia lookup, citation generation, PDF summarization, mathematical equation solving, and academic integrity monitoring.

### 2.4 Ethical AI Monitoring

An ethics tracking system monitors AI usage patterns, provides academic integrity guidance, and maintains usage logs to ensure responsible AI assistance throughout the academic process.

### 2.5 Data Persistence and State Management

The system implements comprehensive project persistence using SQLAlchemy models for thesis projects, phases, tasks, and milestones. Frontend state management utilizes React hooks and session storage for temporary data, with automatic synchronization to the backend for permanent storage.
